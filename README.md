# Python-Data-Visualisation

This Python script aims to investigate the regional disparities in Age-Standardised Mortality Rates (ASMR) in England between 2018 and 2022.

The data comes from two datasets published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) - https://www.ons.gov.uk/.

The data is firstly processed in the 'Retrieving and Processing Data' section and then analysed in the 'ASMR Data Analysis' section.
